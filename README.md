# Greenlight ‚Äî Movie API in Go

Greenlight is a JSON API for retrieving and managing movie information, built in Go with a focus on clean architecture, performance, and production-ready practices.

The API exposes endpoints for movies, users, authentication tokens, and application health/metrics. PostgreSQL is used for persistent storage, and the service is intended to be deployed on a Linux server environment.
